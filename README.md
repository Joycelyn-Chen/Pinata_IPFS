## Problem being solved: 
- Traceability: When photos are uploaded, there is a CID attached to that photo such that no one else can claim your work as their own.
- Storage limits: If your local storage is limited, you can upload your info to a different node and utilize that storage (cannot choose which node to store it on). 25gb upload per pin. 
- Understandability: You can upload data with additional information such as a summary, title, ect.
